# Copilot Studio Empowered by Azure

This solution empowers organisations to rapidly build and deploy intelligent copilots using a low-code platform integrated with Azure AI. Enabling Fusion Teams, IT Leaders, and Solution Architects with Copilot Studio and Azure—building secure, scalable, and task-specific AI workflows for enterprise innovation. This repository provides a clear and practical guide to implementing Copilot Studio with Azure, featuring real-world examples and actionable insights on when and how this combination delivers value.

# What

Copilot Studio is a graphical, low-code tool for building agents and agent flows, whose capabilities can be further enhanced by leveraging the full potential of Azure AI

# Why

We typically use Copilot Studio with Azure AI when we need to go a step further:

- Optimizing and customizing our RAG implementation. 
- It allows us to introduce information that was previously underrepresented and enrich the foundation of our LLM-based model.
- Rapid Prototyping + Deep customization
- Integrates natively with Microsoft 365 Platform
- Tailored Solutions, Use fine tunning Models for specific use cases, providing more relevant and context-aware outcomes

Use cases:

- Enhancing answer accuracy by leveraging advanced search capabilities. ( AI Search)
- Steering the LLM outputs in a specific style or tone. ( Fine Tunning)
  
# When

Copilot Studio empowered by Azure is recommended in scenarios when:

- The out-of-the-box capabilities of Copilot Studio aren't enough.
- You require highly accurate AI responses to meet specific client requirements.
- Involving complex databases that demand customization. 
- You have a clear understanding of what needs to be emphasized in the search process. 
- You have access to thousands of high-quality examples and verified data.
