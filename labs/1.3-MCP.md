# Lab 1.3: Integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) in Copilot Studio

## Objectives
- Add and configure the Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool
- Connect to Microsoft Dataverse using OpenAPI
- Test and validate your agent’s real-time data access

## Prerequisites

It's required to have completed **[Lab 0.0 - Create an agent](./0.0-create-an-agent.md)** to follow this part.

## Contents

This lab guides you through integrating MCP with Microsoft Copilot Studio, helping you understand its functionality, use cases, and the advantages of leveraging this connection.

## Estimated Completion Time

30 minutes

## Task 1: Add the MCP Tool

1. Open your agent in Copilot Studio.
2. Go to the **Tools** section.

Note: Think of MCP as a universal adapter for AI applications. It standardizes how AI models access external tools, APIs, and knowledge bases. By leveraging MCP, you can easily connect to data sources, access a marketplace of existing servers and utilize flexible action capabilities.


4. Search for **Model Context Protocol**.

Note: You can add [your own Model Context Protocol server] (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/mcp-add-existing-server-to-agent) 

## Task 3: Test Your Agent

1. Open the **Test your agent** pane.

2. Try the following queries:
   - “Show me my contacts”
   - “Create a new lead with name John Doe”
3. Confirm that the agent retrieves or writes data in real time.

## Tips for Success

### Metadata Matters
- Use clear table names and descriptions in Dataverse.
- Add synonyms and definitions to improve natural language understanding.


### Centralised MCP Server
- Reuse a single MCP server across multiple agents.
- Only duplicate if isolation is required.

### Limitations
There are some known issues and planned improvements for MCP in Microsoft Copilot Studio. They are listed in this [Microsoft Learn article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/agent-extend-action-mcp#known-issues--planned-improvements).
