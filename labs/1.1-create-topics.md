## Exercise 1: Add specific topics of conversation

### Task 1: Enable Orchestration based on generative AI

1. Enable generative orchestration means Copilot Studio understands the intent of the user processing the prompt provided by the user in natural language and determines the best item to trigger, in the **Overview** tab enable (if you didn’t it previously) the toggle with name **Orchestration**

3. In the very first building block of the topic **‘Trigger’** (which is used to describe what the topic does), write the following: ‘This topic answers exclusively questions where price is requested: Can you provide the pricing details for Power Platform licenses?, what is the price for Power Automate premium licenses?, Give the price for a Copilot message in pay as you go?’
