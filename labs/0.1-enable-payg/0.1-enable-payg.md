# Lab 0.1: Enable Pay-as-you-go for Copilot Studio

## Objectives

- Exercise: Enable Pay as you go for Copilot Studio in your tenant
    - Task 1: Understand Copilot Studio licensing options
    - Task 2: Create a billing plan for pay-as-you-go (if none is available already)


## Contents

In this lab, you will learn about Copilot Studio licensing options and configure your tenant to use Pay-as-you-go, a flexible way to pay for Copilot Studio using an Azure subscription. This allows you to get started building agents without any license commitment or upfront purchasing. With the pay-as-you-go meter, at the end of each month, your organization pays only for the actual number of Copilot Credits its agents use during the month.

## Prerequisites

It's required to have completed **[Lab 0.0 - Create an agent](../0.0-create-an-agent/0.0-create-an-agent.md)** to follow this part.

In order to set up pay-as-you-go billing for an environment, you first need

  * An active Azure subscription that you can link to that environment. A resource group within this subscription. 

  * The user following this procedure requires `Owner` or `Contributor` role in Azure, both at the Subscription and the resource group.

  * The user following this procedure requires **one** of the following roles in the Power Platform Admin Center: `Environment admin`, `Power Platform admin`, `Global admin`, `Dynamics 365 admin`.
 
  * Validate the most updated pre-requisites [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/pay-as-you-go-set-up).


## Estimated Completion Time

- 30 minutes


## Exercise 1: Link your environment to an Azure Subscription (Pay-as-you-go)

In the Power Platform admin center, you can link environments to an Azure subscription using a billing policy. Linking an environment to an Azure subscription turns on billing through Azure meters. Any app usage or Dataverse and Power Platform usage that exceeds the included amounts is billed to the Azure subscription.

> **When to use Pay-as-you-go**: This approach is ideal for development, testing, proof-of-concepts, or scenarios with unpredictable usage patterns. For production deployments with consistent usage, consider Copilot Credits Capacity Packs which may be more cost-effective.

### Task 1: Understanding Copilot Studio Licensing

#### 1. Core licensing concept: Copilot credits
Copilot Studio consumption is measured using Copilot Credits, which represent the compute and effort required for an agent to:
- Retrieve information
- Generate responses
- Execute actions (workflows, AI tools, custom skills)

Copilot Credits act as a **common currency** across all Copilot Studio capabilities, and the number of credits consumed depends on task complexity.

#### 2. Three Consumption & Purchase models
#### 2.1 Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) Meter

Designed for flexibility, variable workloads, and seasonal scenarios.

- Billing model: Organizations pay per number of credit consumed each month via Azure. No upfront commitment.
- Consumption overages: No service interruption due to credit overages
- Administration:
  - Requires Copilot Studio Author (Environment Maker) role to build/manage agents
  - Author role itself has no license cost
  - Copilot Studio access: Needs updating "Copilot Authors" tenant setting in Power Platform Admin Center (PPAC).
- Billing scope: Configured per environment via a billing plan

#### 2.2 Copilot Studio License (Copilot Credit Capacity Pack)

Aimed at predictable, steady Copilot usage.

- Billing Model: Monthly subscription (per tenant). Included capacity is 25,000 Copilot Credits per pack per month. Credits do not roll over month‑to‑month
- Consumption overages:
  - PAYG can be configured as a safety net
  - PAYG then is only billed after capacity packs are exhausted
- Administration:
  - Requires Copilot Studio User License per author and Copilot Studio Author (Environment Maker) role to build/manage agents
  - Copilot Studio User License has no cost
- Billing scope: Can be configured by environment and agent.

#### 2.3 Copilot Credits Pre‑Purchase Plan

Optimized for organizations committing to higher annual usage with cost predictability.

- Billing Model: One-year, prepaid commitment via Copilot Credit Commit Units (CCCUs). 1 CCCU is equivalent to 100 Copilot Credits. Credits expire after one year.
- Consumption overages: Same as Copilot Credit Capacity packs.
- Administration: Same as Copilot Credit Capacity packs.
- Billing scope: Same as Copilot Credit Capacity packs.


#### 2.4 Microsoft Agent Pre-Purchase Plan (P3) Plan

Unified purchasing construct that spans Microsoft Foundry and Copilot Credits* enabled agentic services.

- Billing Model: One-year, prepaid commitment via. Use the same budget across both Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio.
- 32 services included: Tap into Azure AI Search, Cognitive Services, Direct Models, Copilot Studio, and more—all under one plan.
- Administration: [Reservations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/agent-pre-purchase)in Azure Portal. 

#### 3. Includes Use rights with Microsoft 365 Copilot

- Microsoft 365 Copilot User Subscription License (USL) includes limited Copilot Studio use rights
- Usage is restricted to employee‑facing scenarios and bound by a fair‑usage limit
- Agents built for Teams, SharePoint, or Microsoft 365 Copilot are included when operating under the licensed user’s identity

<br>

> **Note:** 
> - Authoring vs. Consumption 
>   - Author roles/licenses have no cost
>   - Actual cost is driven entirely by Copilot Credit Consumption
> - Capacity Enforcement
>   - All purchased capacity is enforced monthly 
>   - Unused monthly credits do not carry over
>   - Sustained overuse can result in technical enforcement including service denial
>- For the most current licensing information, pricing, and detailed feature comparisons, refer to the official [Microsoft Copilot Studio licensing documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/requirements-licensing).

### Task 2: Create a billing plan (if none is available already)

1. Go to Power Platform Admin Center https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/ and select your environment

2. Navigate to Licensing > Copilot Studio

3. Click **Create a billing plan** (if none is already created)

4. Provide the required fields:

    * **Name**: Provide a name. Only alphanumeric characters allowed, like `MCSPAYG`.

    * **Azure Subscription**: Select the subscription to be linked.

    * **Resource group**: Select a resource group on this subscription. The Power Platform account resource—that's associated with this billing plan—is created in this resource group. If there are no resource groups in the specified subscription, you need to create one in the Azure portal before proceeding.

    * **Power Platform products**: Select `Copilot Studio`and in case you haven't got Dataverse capacity available in your tenant `Dataverse` as well. `Power Automate` is optional just in case you want invoke Enterprise automations (Cloud Flows).

4. Click **Next**

5. Choose the region where your desired environment is located, select the environment in the list, and click **Save**

5. Your new billing plan is created.

## Next Steps

After setting up your billing plan:

1. Start building agents in Copilot Studio
2. Monitor your usage and costs
3. Consider transitioning to standalone licenses if usage becomes consistent
4. Review the [Power Platform licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130) for detailed information
5. Use the [Microsoft agent usage estimator](https://microsoft.github.io/copilot-studio-estimator/)
