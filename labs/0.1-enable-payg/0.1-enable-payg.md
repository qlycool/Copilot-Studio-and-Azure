# Lab 0.1: Enable Pay-as-you-go for Copilot Studio

## Objectives

- Exercise: Enable Pay as you go for Copilot Studio in your tenant
    - Task 1: Understand Copilot Studio licensing options
    - Task 2: Create a billing plan for pay-as-you-go (if none is available already)


## Contents

In this lab, you will learn about Copilot Studio licensing options and configure your tenant to use Pay-as-you-go, a flexible way to pay for Copilot Studio using an Azure subscription. This allows you to get started building agents without any license commitment or upfront purchasing. With the pay-as-you-go meter, at the end of each month, your organization pays only for the actual number of Copilot Credits its agents use during the month.

### Understanding Copilot Studio Licensing

Microsoft Copilot Studio offers multiple licensing options to suit different organizational needs:

#### 1. Pay-as-you-go (Azure-billed)
- **Best for**: Testing, development, or variable usage scenarios
- **Billing**: Usage-based pricing through Azure subscription
- **Credits**: Billed monthly based on actual consumption
- **No commitment**: Start and stop as needed without license purchases

#### 2. Standalone Licenses (User-based)
Microsoft offers standalone per-user licenses that include a monthly allocation of Copilot Credits:

- **Copilot Studio Premium (P1)**: Standard license for individual users
  - Includes message capacity for building and deploying agents
  - Suitable for most business scenarios
  
- **Copilot Studio Agent Factory (P3)**: Advanced license for agent deployment
  - Designed for organizations deploying agents at scale
  - Higher message capacity allocation
  - Enables multiple agents to serve users without per-user licensing
  - Ideal for customer-facing scenarios or large-scale internal deployments

#### 3. Microsoft 365 Copilot
- Includes access to Copilot Studio with limited capabilities
- Allows extending Microsoft 365 Copilot with custom agents
- Additional credits may be purchased through pay-as-you-go or standalone licenses

> **Note**: For the most current licensing information, pricing, and detailed feature comparisons, refer to the official [Microsoft Copilot Studio licensing documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/requirements-licensing).



## Prerequisites

It's required to have completed **[Lab 0.0 - Create an agent](../0.0-create-an-agent/0.0-create-an-agent.md)** to follow this part.

In order to set up pay-as-you-go billing for an environment, you first need

  * An active Azure subscription that you can link to that environment. A resource group within this subscription. 

  * The user following this procedure requires `Owner` or `Contributor` role in Azure, both at the Subscription and the resource group.

  * The user following this procedure requires **one** of the following roles in the Power Platform Admin Center: `Environment admin`, `Power Platform admin`, `Global admin`, `Dynamics 365 admin`.
 
  * Validate the most updated pre-requisites [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/pay-as-you-go-set-up).


## Estimated Completion Time

- 30 minutes


## Exercise 1: Link your environment to an Azure Subscription (Pay-as-you-go)

In the Power Platform admin center, you can link environments to an Azure subscription using a billing policy. Create a billing policy associated with your Azure subscription in Power Platform admin center.

Linking an environment to an Azure subscription turns on billing through Azure meters. Any app usage or Dataverse and Power Platform usage that exceeds the included amounts is billed to the Azure subscription.

> **When to use Pay-as-you-go**: This approach is ideal for development, testing, proof-of-concepts, or scenarios with unpredictable usage patterns. For production deployments with consistent usage, consider standalone licenses (P1 or P3) which may be more cost-effective.

### Task 1: Create a billing plan (if none is available already)

1. Go to Power Platform Admin Center https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/ and select your environment

2. Navigate to Licensing > Copilot Studio

3. Click **Create a billing plan** (if none is already created)

4. Provide the required fields:

    * **Name**: Provide a name. Only alphanumeric characters allowed, like `MCSPAYG`.

    * **Azure Subscription**: Select the subscription to be linked.

    * **Resource group**: Select a resource group on this subscription. The Power Platform account resource—that's associated with this billing plan—is created in this resource group. If there are no resource groups in the specified subscription, you need to create one in the Azure portal before proceeding.

    * **Power Platform products**: Select `Dataverse`, `Power Automate`, `Copilot Studio`.

4. Click **Next**

## Additional Information

### Choosing the Right Licensing Option

Consider these factors when selecting a licensing approach:

| Scenario | Recommended License |
|----------|-------------------|
| Development and testing | Pay-as-you-go |
| Small team of builders (1-50 users) | Copilot Studio Premium (P1) |
| Enterprise-wide deployment | Copilot Studio Agent Factory (P3) |
| Customer-facing agents (high volume) | Agent Factory (P3) + Pay-as-you-go overage |
| Extending Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft 365 Copilot license + optional credits |

### Monitoring Usage and Costs

- **Pay-as-you-go**: Monitor costs through Azure Cost Management
- **Standalone licenses**: Track usage in Power Platform Admin Center under "Manage Copilot Credits"
- Set up billing alerts in Azure to avoid unexpected charges
- Review consumption patterns regularly to optimize licensing approach

### Next Steps

After setting up your billing plan:

1. Start building agents in Copilot Studio
2. Monitor your usage and costs
3. Consider transitioning to standalone licenses if usage becomes consistent
4. Review the [Power Platform licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130) for detailed information
